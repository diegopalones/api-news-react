## About the project

### üí´ Instalation and deployment

To download the repository, in Visual Studio, open a terminal and run the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/diegopalones/api-news-react.git
```
 
Next you will have to download the external modules with node (Axios, Sass). To do this, run the following command.

```
$ npm i
```

Then, run the React application in our browser through:

```
$ npm start
```


### üíª Used technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* Sass
* Javascript
* React
* React-GlobalContext
* React-Router



### ‚öîÔ∏è Objectives:

Create a REST API that is capable of the following:
* A React mini-project to practice all the basic React elements already seen.
* Implementing a "news website", in this case a digital magazine.
* Using [NYT News API](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) 
* Using the React router
* Using nested components (header, home, footer, form, news list).
* Use React Context
* Use SASS




### ‚öîÔ∏è functions

In this digital magazine, we have two main elements: Home and Form. In the first element, we can read the articles collected by the API and in the second one, we can send articles to the localStorage.

### ‚öîÔ∏è React Router

Thanks to React Router we can create different routes within our React application in a SPA and navigate between components (articles and form).

 

### ‚öîÔ∏è Sass

By implementing Sass, we can make use of variables for the colours, fonts and widths of the various elements during the layout, so that we can reuse and modify them later. 

## üîú Future implementations

* Responsive design. 
* Create a variable to allow different API calls and change the content of the magazine. 
* Delete old images once they are updated.
